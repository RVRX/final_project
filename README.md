## General description



Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:
- Static web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript (TypeScript is also allowed if your group wants to explore it).
- Server-side programming *using Node.js*. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data (database), authentication, and possibly server-side computation. 
- A video (less than five minutes) where each group member explains some aspect of the project. An easy way to produce this video is for you all the groups members to join a Zoom call that is recorded; each member can share their screen when they discuss the project or one member can "drive" the interface while other members narrate (this second option will probably work better.) The video should be posted on YouTube or some other accessible video hosting service. Make sure your video is less than five minutes, but long enough to successfully  explain your project and show it in action. There is no minimum video length.

## Project ideation
Excellent projects typically serve someone/some group; for this assignment you need to define your users and stakeholders. I encourage you to identify projects that will have impact, either artistically, politically, or in terms of productivity. 

### Deliverables

#### Form Team (due 9/25)
Students are will work in teams of 3-5 students for the project; teams of two can be approved with the permission of the instructor. Working in teams should help enable you to build a good project in a limited amount of time.  Use the `#project-logistics` channel in Discord to pitch ideas for final projects and/or find fellow team members as needed.

Teams must be in place by end of day on Sunday, September 25th. If you have not identified a team at this point, you will be assigned a team. You will be given some class time on Monday to work on your proposal, but please plan on reserving additional time outside of class as needed.

#### Proposal (due 9/27) 
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of associated team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. Please include a general description of a project, and list of key technologies/libraries you plan on using (e.g. React, Three.js, Svelte, TypeScript etc.). Two to four paragraps should provide enough level of detail. Name the file proposal.md and submit a pull request by Tuesday, September 27th at 11:59 PM (end of day). Only one pull request is required per team.

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project. 

#### Turning in Your Project
Submit a second PR on the final project repo to turn in your app and code. Again, only one pull request per team.

Deploy your app, in the form of a webpage, to Glitch/Heroku/Digital Ocean or some other service; it is critical that the application functions correctly wherever you post it.

The README for your second pull request doesn’t need to be a formal report, but it should contain:

1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)

Our project is a “Cookie Clicker”-esque game, but with Gompei as the object to be clicked. As you click Gompei you will gain “goat bucks” for each click. You can purchase ‘upgrades’ to automate or improve your clicking. You can login via Github OAuth and your upgrades and scores will be saved either once every minute or manually. There is a global top-10 scoreboard for all players to see who is the best Gompei Clicker out there. The game also features a playlist soundtrack and Favicon tab icon.

3. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)
4. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
5. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
6. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
7. A link to your project video.

Think of 1,3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / tech achievements for A1—A4… make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

## FAQs

- **Can I use XYZ framework?** You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available, but for your server programming you need to use Node.js. Your client-side scripting language should be either JavaScript or TypeScript.
